CODE GUIDELINES PYTHON
----------------------

* Objects must always inherit from 'object' (i.e. new-style objects)

* Always use unicode when dealing with strings on transfer objects, or strings with user content
  * Note, sometimes string must be used e.g. when dealing with certain external libraries
    * e.g. set_cookie gave errors with unicode string
  * Also, constant strings should be prepended with u e.g. u"string" u"""string""" u'string'

* All code should be internationalizable. Apart from using unicode everywhere when dealing
  with user content, the strings should come from a message map which can be translated.
  Take care of positional arguments while translating
